# Simple_Interest_Calculator
This NGO works to improve the financial literacy of the common people. They have hired a developer to create an online application. This app titled **Simple Interest Calculator**, will compute the interest one can earn given the amount you wish to save, the number of years you can keep it with the bank and the interest rate the bank would pay you.

The NGO is very particular about the way the app looks including the **_colors and the alignment_** of the form elements.
